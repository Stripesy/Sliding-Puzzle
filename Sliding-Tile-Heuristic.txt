The heuristic used is the number of White tiles with at least one Black tile to their side.

The heuristic is admissible as to get past a black tile the white tile must jump over that black tile or multiple.
The cost for moving over tiles is one per tile. 
This ensures the h(n) <= Optimal Cost as for each black tile a white tile is able to jump over, thus decreasing the heuristic by one, the cost is increased by one.
